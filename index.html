            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>An image line segment is a fundamental low-level visual feature that delineates straight, slender, and uninterrupted portions of objects and scenarios within images. Detection and description of line segments lay the basis for numerous vision tasks. Although many studies have aimed to detect and describe line segments, a comprehensive review is lacking, obstructing their progress. This study fills the gap by comprehensively reviewing related studies on detecting and describing two-dimensional image line segments to provide researchers with an overall picture and deep understanding. Based on their mechanisms, two taxonomies for line segment detection and description are presented to introduce, analyze, and summarize these studies, facilitating researchers to learn about them quickly and extensively. The key issues, core ideas, advantages and disadvantages of existing methods, and their potential applications for each category are analyzed and summarized, including previously unknown findings. The challenges in existing methods and corresponding insights for potentially solving them are also provided to inspire researchers. In addition, some state-of-the-art line segment detection and description algorithms are evaluated without bias, and the evaluation code will be publicly available. The theoretical analysis, coupled with the experimental results, can guide researchers in selecting the best method for their intended vision applications. Finally, this study provides insights for potentially interesting future research directions to attract more attention from researchers to this field.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As a typical two-dimensional (2D) low-level image feature, line segments contain more structural and geometric features about the scene than points and are more compact in data expression than edges. Because of these excellent characteristics, line segments are widely used in numerous vision tasks, such as visual measurement, camera pose estimation, visual odometry (VO), visual simultaneous mapping and localization (V-SLAM), and structure from motion (SFM). In these vision tasks, line segments lay the foundation for other processes by providing line segment matches in different images containing the same scene.</p>

            <h2>Taxonomies of Line Segment Detection and Description</h2>
            <p>Based on their mechanisms, two taxonomies for line segment detection and description are presented to introduce, analyze, and summarize these studies. The first taxonomy categorizes line segment detection methods into four categories: global Hough-based methods, local-based methods, learning-based methods, and hybrid-based methods. The second taxonomy categorizes line segment description methods into three categories: statistic-based methods, structure-based methods, and learning-based methods.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
            <p>Despite numerous studies aimed at detecting and describing line segments from images, certain generic challenges remain in this field. Specifically, the unstable endpoints of line segments, imperfect detection and description methods, unsatisfactory performance in challenging scenarios, and shortage of gold-standard datasets are some of the key challenges. This study provides insights for potentially interesting future research directions, including line segment detection and description in color space, spatiotemporal domain, cross-modality, and other image formats, as well as hardware architecture design and implementation.</p>
